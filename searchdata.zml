Cell pack containers to protect fragile items like glasses and stemware. Only new packing materials on every move (or,if you prefer,recycled packing materials, when available) Custom crating built to match your large and extremely fragile item's Custom wrapping for fine-finish woods or upholstery items Blanket padding protects furniture from nicks / scratches Shrink-wrap for furniture as added in-transit protection At a low cost, The Flat Rate Movers will unpack the boxes, placing the items on the nearest flat surface, and then remove the packing debris from your home. This partial unpacking service allows you the freedom to put things away at your leisure – and preference. However, if you'd prefer, The Flat Rate Movers will unpack all items, remove the resulting debris, and place the items according to your direction (certain terms and conditions apply). This means the only finger you'll need to lift is the one to point the crew in the right direction. Of course, some people prefer to unpack everything themselves. And that's entirely up to you. However, anything that was disassembled by The Flat Rate Movers prior to the relocation, such as a table, will be reassembled at your new home for no extra charge.
